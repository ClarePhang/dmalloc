 * a bit, so to simplify I use define statements.  This in turn
 * complicates debugging :-) -- a trade-off.  The comments at the end
 * of the define statements show when the field in the union is used.
 * For instance, db_size (really db_info.in_nums.nu_size) is in use

 * the admin structure is on the free list.
