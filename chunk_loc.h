 * allocations will be put into 1 basic-block, each getting one of
 * these admin structures.  Or 4 1k allocations, or 8 512 byte
 * allocations, etc.
 *
 * In an attempt to keep per-pointer overhead as low as possible I use a
 * lot of unions in this structure.  This tends to complicate the code
 * a bit, so to simplify I use define statements.  This in turn
 * complicates debugging :-) -- a trade-off.  The comments at the end
 * of the define statements show when the field in the union is used.
 * For instance, db_size (really db_info.in_nums.nu_size) is in use
 * when the pointer is Alloc[at]ed.  The db_next field is used when
 * the admin structure is on the free list.
