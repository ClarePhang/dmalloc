REPOSITORY:

Currently, you can get the newest and bestest versions of the
malloc_dbg library from anonymous ftp via ftp.psc.edu in the
/pub/malloc_dbg directory.

This repository has been made available through the generosity of the
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center with special help from Doug Balog.

Thanks much to them both.

ANTAIRE REPOSITORY:

In the future (possibly currently depending on the age of this file),
also try ftp.antaire.com in the /pub/antaire/malloc_dbg directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GZIP:

All the files in this directory have been gzip'ed.  Gzip, the gnu
compression program, is much superior to compress and is also free
software.  It can be found on your nearest gnu archive by anonymous
ftp (one example is ftp.uu.net in the /packages/gnu directory).
