REPOSITORY:

Currently, you can get the newest and bestest versions of the
malloc_dbg library from anonymous ftp via gatekeeper.dec.com in the
/pub/misc/malloc_dbg directory.

The versions in this repository also include such files as a
postscript version of the manual and other large files which may not
have been included in the distribution you recieved.

This repository has been made available through the generosity of the
Digital Equipment Corporation with special help from Dave Hill and the
gatekeepers.

Thanks much to them all.

Additional thanks to Doug Balog and Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
for past repository space and assistance.

ANTAIRE REPOSITORY:

In the future (possibly currently depending on the age of this file),
also try ftp.antaire.com in the /pub/antaire/malloc_dbg directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GZIP:

All the files in this directory have been gzip'ed.  Gzip, the gnu
compression program, is much superior to compress and is also free
software.  It can be found on your nearest gnu archive by anonymous
ftp (one example is ftp.uu.net in the /packages/gnu directory).
