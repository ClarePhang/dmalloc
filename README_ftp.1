MALLOC_DEBUG:

The malloc_dbg library has been designed as a drop in replacement for
the system's malloc, realloc, calloc, free and other memory management
routines while providing powerful heap-memory debugging facilities.

The module is reasonably portable having been successfully run on the
following operating systems: BSDI, SunOS, Solaris, AIX, Ultrix, OSF,
Irix, HPUX, MS-DOG, and probably a couple others.

The package includes the library, configuration scripts, debug
utility application, test program, extensive documentation (text,
texi, info, ps), and samples.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPOSITORY:

The newest versions of the malloc_dbg library are available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.antaire.com in the /antaire/src/malloc_dbg
directory.  (URL ftp://ftp.antaire.com/antaire/src/malloc_dbg)

The versions in this repository also include such files as a
postscript version of the manual and other large files which may not
have been included in the distribution you received.

OTHER REPOSITORIES:

You can also get a recent version from anonymous ftp via
gatekeeper.dec.com in the /pub/misc/malloc_dbg directory.  This
repository has been made available through the generosity of the
Digital Equipment Corporation with special help from Dave Hill and the
gatekeepers.

Thanks much to them all.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GZIP:

All the files in this directory have been gzip'ed.  Gzip, the gnu
compression program, is much superior to compress and is also free
software.  It can be found on your nearest gnu archive by anonymous
ftp (one example is ftp.uu.net in the /packages/gnu directory).

If you cannot find it, a recent version should be located on
ftp.antaire.com in the /gnu/src directory.
