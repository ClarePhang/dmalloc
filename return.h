/*
 * this file contains the definition of the SET_RET_ADDR macro which
 * is designed to contain the archecture/compiler specific hacks to
 * determine the return-address from inside the malloc library.  With
 * this information, the library can display caller information from
 * calls that do not use the malloc_lp functions.
 *
 * Most of the archectures here have been contributed by other
 * individuals and may need to be toggled a bit to remove local
 * configuration differences.
 *
 * Please send all submissions, comments, problems to the author.
 *
 * NOTE: examining the assembly code for x = __builtin_return_address(0);
 * with gcc version 2+ should give you a good start on building a hack
 * for your box.
