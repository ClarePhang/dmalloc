- The file malloc-tutorial is a gnu-info file having the user-documentation for
	the malloc subsystem.  It is also suitable for reading as text.
- The file Manifest contains a list of each of the file and what it does
- typing 'make' should be enough to build libmalloc.a
- typing 'make test' should build the malloc_t test program
- debugging programs using libmalloc relies on the setting of the MALLOC_DEBUG
	environmental variable (see malloc.txt for more information.

- I am using gnu-make and gcc which is ansi-prototype compatible.
- BTW: if you don't have them, you have to get them.  they're hot!!
- the system is definately dependant on a good ansi-c compiler like gcc.
- feel free to send me mail with porting issues.

If you are using this library please provide some feedback to me so I can keep
abreast of problems as well as can inform you of new versions.
