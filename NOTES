WARNING:
	- watch for heaps growing up or down (all subtraction or other position
		dependent code must be changed to macros in heap.h) >,<,-,+,etc
	- watch for bounds checking assuming + or - code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- dumping core on errors and then continuing ddid not look to be a problem to
	implement but became not recommended as soon as it was discovered that
	fork (which is needed) calls malloc itself.  If the heap was corrupted
	or some other error then it would quickly go recursive.

- administration blocks are relocatable:
	- any administration blocks are relocatable in the heap which means
		that if we monitor the freeing of a block we have the
		opportunity to swap a higher admin block down which would mean
		we could possible locate as many admin blocks as possible in
		low memory making more contiguous usable areas

	- you have the freed blocks address

	- as you go through the admin blocks, until you get to the right entry,
		save a pointer to the highest (or lowest) one

	- when you find the free block, find out if it is lower (or higher)
		than the highest admin block and bcopy the admin block down and
		redo the pointers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DBLOCK METHOD:

- have the bblock admin struct point to the dblock admin structure block which
	contains a number of dblock admin entries.
- have a global pointer that points to last free dblock admin structure entry
	and has a count of the number left in the block
- only allocate contiguous dblock admin slots so have some fragmentation
	- must have contiguous because bblocks do not have pointer to start of
		array
- maybe have a sorted free list of the number of free dblock admin structs.
	sorted in descending order
- you have the free pointer which gets you to the bblock where you can see if
	it is a dblock and if it is on the correct boundary.  Then you go to
	the dblock admin struct to get the file, line, size info.
- the bblock tells you of the number of bits in the chunk, etc.
- have some way to run through the dblock admin slot blocks to verify that
	crc's have not been overwritten.

OVERHEAD:

- dblock: 8 bytes per pointer
- bblock: 12 bytes per pointer
