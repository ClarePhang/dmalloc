Description of the files in the malloc package.

COPYING-LIB		The famous GNU Library Public License.

Changelog		Change log entries detailing major module changes.

Makefile.all		Makefile for the malloc library.

Manifest		This file.

NOTES			General Notes of the malloc routines and associated
			algorithms.

README			Quick startup notes.

TTD			Things To Do list.

chunk.[ch]		Lower level allocation routines.  This is the meat of
			the allocation algorithms.  Manages and debugs the
			administration structures of the heap.  Too large!

chunk_loc.h		Local defines specific to the chunk routines only.

debug_tokens.h		Tokens that correspond to debug-flags.

error.[ch]		Debugging routines and others that provide user output.

error_strings.h		Strings that correspond to malloc error codes.

heap.[ch]		Possibly machine specific routines for allocating space
			on and manipulating the heap.

		NOTE:	Heap.h contains a number of macros that may need to be
			defined for each machine type.

malloc.[ch]		Higher level alloc routines including malloc, free,
			realloc, etc.  These are the routines to be called
			from user space.

malloc.info		User-level gnu info manual file for the malloc
			routines.  Suitable as a text manual also.

malloc.texinfo		Texinfo user manual for TeX or Info formats.

malloc_debug.c		Program that assists in the setting of the MALLOC_DEBUG
			and other debug environmental variables.

malloc_errno.h		General error codes for the malloc module.

malloc_loc.h		Local defines for all of the malloc routines.

malloc_test.c		Meager test program for testing the malloc routines.

mallocrc		Sample RC file that is used to set the debug flags.

proto.h			Some machine specific functions and defines.

sample.c		A sample file to demonstrate the usage of the library.
