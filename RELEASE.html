<H3><A NAME="overview"> Overview </A></H3>

<P> Small feature and bug fix release.  Fixed the Linux strdup problem
and also rewrote the dmalloc utility internals a good bit.

<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="func"> New Functionality </A></H3>

<UL>

<P><LI> The dmalloc utility will now look in the current directory for
.dmallocrc before checking your $HOME directory.

<P><LI> Increased the internal storage of C filename sizes from 40 to
100 characters.

</UL>

<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="dmalloc"> Dmalloc Utility Changes </A></H3>

<UL>

<P><LI> The dmalloc utility will now look in the current directory for
.dmallocrc before checking your $HOME directory.  This helps
programmers have per-module specific dmalloc settings and controls.

<P><LI> Rewrote a significant portion of the internals of the dmalloc
utility.  It's processing of the RC files has been much improved.

</UL>

<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="settings.dist"> Changes to the settings.dist File </A></H3>

<UL>

<P><LI> Added USE_DMALLOC_LEAP variable which enables the library's
leap functionality.  The leap stuff allows you to disable the library
by just linking in the libdmalloc_lp.a library instead of having to
recompile your source files which included dmalloc.h.  This was
removed as a default feature since a poll on the dmalloc mailing list
found few people aware of the feature and only one developer actually
used it.

</UL>

<HR>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="programming"> Programming Notes </A></H3>

<UL>

<P><LI> Added support for the PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER define which
is defined on some systems.

</UL>

<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="env"> Environmental Variable Changes </A></H3>

<UL>

<P> None.

</UL>

<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="bugs"> Bugs Fixed </A></H3>

<UL>

<P><LI> Newer versions of Linux (6.X?) define strdup as a macro which
was confusing prototypes in dmalloc.h.  I added some specific
autoconfiguration to handle this problem.

<P><LI> Increased the internal storage of C filename sizes from 40 to
100 characters.

<P><LI> In moving away from the leap substrate with the addition of
the USE_DMALLOC_LEAP variable in the settings.dist file, this fixes a
long standing bug with improperly tracking the first memory
transaction -- usually an allocation.  There was a chicken and egg
problem with the way the library bootstrapped which has been resolved.
