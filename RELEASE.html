<h3><a name="overview"> Overview </a></h3>

<p> Mostly a bug fix release but I made some changes to the
dmalloc_examine arguments so a minor release it is. </p>

<h3><a name="func"> New Functionality </a></h3>

<ul>

<li> Expanded the dmalloc_examine function to be able to return more
information about a pointer.  This breaks the API for this function
unfortunately. </li>

<li> Improved the statistics output to the logfile. </li>

<li> Added the tsecs perl script to the contrib/ subdirectory.  The
tsecs script converts time in epoch-seconds (which is by default
written into the logfile) into a readable time/date string. </li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="dmalloc"> Dmalloc Utility Changes </a></h3>

<ul>

<li> The check-lists debug token has been removed since it is no
longer valid with the new memory admin structures. </li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="settings.dist"> Changes to the settings.dist File </a></h3>

<ul>

<li> Removed the PROTECT_BLOCKS entry because it was unused and
unimplemented. </li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="install"> Installation Changes </a></h3>

<blockquote>
None.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="programming"> Programming Notes </a></h3>

<ul>

<li> The arguments to dmalloc_examine were changed to allow this
function to return more information about a pointer.  This was done to
help the test program probe various information about a pointer. </li>

<li> Greatly expanded the dmalloc_t program to test specific bugs as
they were found.  Hope this will become a good regression test
utility. </li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="env"> Environmental Variable Changes </a></h3>

<ul>

<li> The check-lists debug token has been removed since it is no
longer valid with the new memory admin structures. </li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="bugs"> Bugs Fixed </a></h3>

<ul>

<li> Fixed the FREED_POINTER_DELAY functionality where pointers that
have just been freed can not be reused until a certain number of
malloc calls have been made. </li>

<li> Fixed the never-reuse feature where pointers will never be reused
once freed. </li>

<li> Fixed a problem where a call to dmalloc_log_changed would wipe
out allocate table information. </li>

<li> Found and fixed a problem where the last-used mark was not being
set properly. </li>

<li> Found and fixed a bad problem where the leaked memory was not
being reported correctly.  Very bad. </li>

</ul>
