# Sample Malloc rc file for the debug malloc library
# Rename this to .mallocrc and place in your home directory to activate.
# See malloc.info for more information

# Lines in this file should have the form:
#
#	tag	token1, token2, ...
#
# The above 'tag' is then passed to the 'malloc' alias to set the current
# debugging functionality to token1, token2, ...
#
# Tag lines can be finished with a \ meaning it continues onto the next line.
# Lines begining with '#' or empty lines are ignored
#
